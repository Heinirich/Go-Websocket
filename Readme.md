# WebSockets in Go

A simple implementation of WebSockets using Go.

## What is a WebSocket?

A WebSocket is a protocol that allows for bi-directional communication between a client and a server over the web. It is a low-latency, full-duplex communication channel that is established over a single TCP connection. WebSockets are widely used for real-time communication, such as instant messaging, live updates, and gaming.

## How does it work?

A WebSocket is established by the client sending a WebSocket upgrade request to the server. The server then responds with a WebSocket upgrade response to complete the handshake. Once the handshake is complete, the client and server can send messages to each other at any time.

## Applications of WebSockets

WebSockets can be used for a wide range of applications, including:

*   Real-time communication
*   Live updates
*   Gaming
*   Instant messaging
*   Stock tickers
*   Online collaboration
*   Live blogging
*   And much more!
